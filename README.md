# Git Version Control

## What is Git?
- **Definition:** Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that enables tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **Key Features:**
  - Distributed: Every user has their copy of the repository, allowing offline work.
  - Versioning: Records changes made to files over time.
  - Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork and merges contributions seamlessly.

## Benefits of using Git
- **Collaboration:**
  - Multiple developers can work on the same project concurrently.
  - Changes can be easily merged and resolved.
- **Versioning:**
  - Enables the rollback to previous states or versions.
  - Historical changes are well-documented.
- **Branching:**
  - Allows the creation of isolated branches for different features or bug fixes.
  - Experimental changes can be made without affecting the main codebase.

# Welcome and Introduction

## What are the Git Tools
- **Git Bash:**
  - Command-line interface for Git on Windows.
- **Git GUI:**
  - Graphical user interface for Git, providing visual representation of changes.
- **GitKraken, SourceTree:**
  - Third-party tools offering a user-friendly Git interface.

## What are the Git Terminology
- **Repository:**
  - Storage location for a project, containing versioned files and history.
- **Commit:**
  - A snapshot of changes made to the code at a specific point in time.
- **Branch:**
  - A separate line of development, often used for features or bug fixes.
- **Merge:**
  - Combining changes from different branches.

## Basic Git Commands
- **`git init`:**
  - Initializes a new Git repository.
- **`git add`:**
  - Adds changes to the staging area.
- **`git commit`:**

  - The process of preparing changes for commit.
  - Allows selective commitment of changes.
- **Commit:**
  - Saving changes to the local repository.

## Inspect and Undo Changes
- **`git log`:**
  - Displays the commit history.
- **`git diff`:**
  - Shows the difference between changes.
- **Undo Changes:**

  - **`git revert`:** Reverts a commit.

# Collaborating

## What is SDLC?
- **Definition:** Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software systems.

## The Seven Important Phases of SDLC
1. **Planning:**
   - Define project scope, objectives, timelines, and resources.
2. **Analysis:**
   - Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders.
3. **Design:**
   - Create a blueprint for the software's structure and architecture.
4. **Implementation:**
   - Writing code and converting
